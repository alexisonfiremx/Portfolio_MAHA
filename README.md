## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

---

## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/alexisonfiremx/Portfolio_MAHA.git

# Move into the repository
$ cd Portfolio_MAHA

# Remove the current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

After that, you can install the dependencies using NPM.

Simply run the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the development server
$ npm start
```


Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:1234/` to see the portfolio locally.

## Building and Running for Production ü™ê

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```


## Deployment üì¶

Once you finish your setup. You need to put your website online!

I highly recommend to use [Hostgator](https://www.hostgator.mx/) because it is super easy.
